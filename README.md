# Regex Tutorial 

A regular expression, commonly abbreviated as regex or regexp, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It often includes capturing groups to extract specific portions of the matched text during a search within a given input text. For instance, when validating user-provided emails using a regular expression, we can check if the input conforms to the standard email structure. An example pattern to validate emails might be `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`. This pattern ensures that the email follows the structure `xxx@xx.xxx`.

## Description
- The main driving force behind creating this regular expression tutorial was to examine the inner workings in a sequence, in a precise and detailed manner. The goal is to inspire developers by providing a resource crafted by another inspiring developer.
- This tutorial can be used to demonstrate how a regular expression, using an email format, can validate user input to verify whether an email was provided.
- With the successful creation of a public gist, another milestone has been reached in my long journey to becoming a full-stack developer. I am now the one teaching a module.
- After completing this tutorial, I found myself more knowledgeable in using regular expressions, as well as in my ability to explain them coherently.
